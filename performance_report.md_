# Scrap Material Classification Performance Report

## Project Overview
- Goal: Classify scrap materials (metal, plastic, paper, etc.) using CNN-based ResNet18 model.
- Dataset: 12 classes from Kaggle Garbage Classification dataset.
- Pipeline: 
  1. Data preprocessing & augmentation
  2. CNN model training with transfer learning
  3. TorchScript/ONNX export for deployment
  4. Conveyor simulation for real-time frame classification
  5. Active learning via misclassified images


## Model Training Performance

Training Summary:
- Epochs: 5
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
- Training Accuracy: 89%
- Validation Accuracy: 85%
- Key Observations: 
  - Model converged quickly with transfer learning.
  - Slight overfitting noticed after 4th epoch.


## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric    | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Accuracy | 85%   |
| Precision| 84%   |
| Recall   | 83%   |
| F1-score | 83.5% |

## Confusion Matrix:

- Most confusion occurred between glass colors (green, brown, white).  
- Low-confidence predictions flagged for manual review.

## Deployment Simulation

- Conveyor simulation tested on folder/frames.  
- TorchScript model achieved 50 fps on GPU, 5 fps on CPU.  
- Low-confidence threshold: 0.6  
- Misclassified images moved to `retraining_queue/` for active learning.

## Key Takeaways

1. Transfer learning with ResNet18 is effective for scrap classification.
2. Conveyor simulation + logging is a practical approach for industrial validation.
4. Active learning loop ensures model can continuously improve with misclassified images.
5. Future Work:
   - Collect more data for underrepresented classes (glass, clothes, trash)
   - Optimize ONNX model with TensorRT for faster edge inference
   - Integrate live camera feed with automatic sorting actuators
