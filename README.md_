Build a mini classification pipeline that simulates scrap material classification using image data, and
deploy it in a simple real-time simulation loop. The goal is to test your data skills, modeling ability,
deployment awareness, and your documentation & collaboration approach.


## Dataset Preparation
- Use any publicly available dataset (or combinations) with at
least 5 different classes of materials (e.g., metal, plastic,
e-waste, paper, fabric, etc.)
- Perform basic data cleaning, augmentation, and preprocessing
for training readiness.

## Features
- Image classification with 12 classes
- TorchScript / ONNX model export
- Dummy conveyor simulation for real-time frame processing
- Logs predictions + confidence + low-confidence flags
- Saves results to CSV

## Model Development
Build a classification model using CNN-based architecture (ResNet-18)
- Use transfer learning for faster convergence.
- Evaluate with metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, confusion
matrix.

## Lightweight Deployment
Convert model to ONNX or TorchScript and create a
lightweight inference script.
- The script should be capable of taking 1 image/frame and
outputting predicted class & confidence.

## Simulated Real-Time Loop
Build a dummy conveyor simulation that mimics frames being
captured at intervals from a video or image folder.
- For each frame:
→ Classify
→ Log output to console + store in a result CSV
→ Print confidence threshold flag if low.
